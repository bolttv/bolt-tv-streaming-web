TASK: Fix Next.js Hydration Error #418

I'm getting hydration mismatch errors after migrating from Vite to Next.js. 

DIAGNOSE BY CHECKING THESE COMMON CAUSES IN ORDER:

1. INVALID HTML NESTING — Search the entire codebase for:
   - <p> tags wrapping <div>, <p>, <ul>, <ol>, or other block elements
   - <a> tags nested inside other <a> tags
   - <button> inside <button>
   - Any Radix/shadcn component that renders a <p> or <button> being wrapped in another <p> or <button>
   Fix: Change outer <p> to <div> or <span> as appropriate

2. BROWSER-ONLY CODE IN SERVER COMPONENTS — Search for any component WITHOUT "use client" that references:
   - window
   - document
   - localStorage
   - sessionStorage
   - navigator
   - matchMedia
   Fix: Either add "use client" to that component, or wrap the browser code in useEffect

3. COMPONENTS THAT RENDER DIFFERENTLY ON SERVER VS CLIENT — Search for:
   - typeof window !== 'undefined' used in render logic (not in useEffect)
   - Date.now() or new Date() used directly in JSX
   - Math.random() in render
   - Any conditional that would be true on client but false/undefined on server
   Fix: Move these into useEffect + useState pattern:
     const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
     useEffect(() => setMounted(true), []);
     if (!mounted) return null; // or a skeleton

4. SUPABASE AUTH STATE — If AuthContext reads auth state during initial render,
   the server has no session but the client does. This causes mismatch.
   Fix: AuthContext MUST have "use client" and should not render auth-dependent 
   UI until after mount. Use a loading state that matches on both server and client.

5. NEXT-THEMES — If using next-themes for dark mode, it causes hydration mismatch 
   because the server doesn't know the user's theme preference.
   Fix: Add suppressHydrationWarning to the <html> tag in layout.tsx:
     <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
   AND wrap ThemeProvider usage in a mounted check.

6. REPLIT-SPECIFIC — Replit may inject dev scripts or banners into the page.
   Check if the error ONLY happens in Replit's webview vs opening the preview 
   URL in a separate browser tab.

After identifying the cause, fix it and tell me which issue(s) you found.
