I need to restructure the entire sign-up/onboarding flow, add an account settings page, and handle different user states throughout the platform. Here's everything:

New Sign-Up Flow (remove email verification as a blocker):

The current flow requires email verification before users can create their account, which creates friction and was causing redirect issues. I want to flip this so users get instant access. The new flow should be:

User clicks "Get Started" / "Subscribe"
User enters email and creates a password (account is created in Supabase immediately)
User selects a subscription plan and completes payment
User gets instant access to the streaming platform
In the background, a verification email is automatically sent to their email address after step 2
Email verification should NOT block any part of the sign-up, payment, or platform access. Users can verify their email at any time — it's not a gate. In Supabase, unverified users should still have full access to authenticated routes and content. Make sure the Supabase auth config supports this — you may need to disable the "Confirm email" requirement in the auth settings or handle it so that unverified users aren't blocked from signing in.

Handling Users Who Abandon Payment:

If a user creates an account (enters email + password) but exits before completing the payment/plan selection step, the system should still save them as a registered user in Supabase. They should be able to log back in with their credentials at any time.

However, since they don't have an active subscription, their experience inside the platform should reflect that:

Any "Watch Now" button (or whatever the primary CTA is to play content) should instead display as "Upgrade to Watch"
When clicked, "Upgrade to Watch" should redirect the user back to the plan selection/payment page so they can pick a subscription and complete checkout
This means we need a way to check the user's subscription status (e.g., a field like subscription_status or checking against Cleeng for an active plan). If they have no active subscription, they're treated as a free/unpaid user
These users should still be able to browse the platform, see content thumbnails, descriptions, etc. — they just can't play anything until they subscribe
Essentially there are three user states the UI needs to account for:

No account — sees the public marketing/landing page, CTAs say "Get Started" or "Subscribe"
Account created, no subscription — can log in and browse but can't watch content. CTAs say "Upgrade to Watch" and redirect to the plan/payment page
Account created, active subscription — full access. CTAs say "Watch Now" and play content
Make sure the UI dynamically reflects whichever state the logged-in user is in.

New Account Settings Page (for logged-in users):

I need an account settings page accessible from within the platform when users are signed in. It should include at minimum:

Profile information (email, display name if applicable)
Subscription/plan details
Password management
Email verification status
If a user's email is NOT yet verified, display a persistent notification banner at the top of the settings page prompting them to verify. Something like: "Your email hasn't been verified yet. Check your inbox or click here to resend the verification email." Include a resend verification email button. This banner should only appear on the settings page — don't block access to any other part of the platform because of an unverified email.

Context on what was already fixed:

I updated the Supabase Dashboard under Authentication → URL Configuration — set the Site URL to https://bolt-tv-web.up.railway.app and added https://bolt-tv-web.up.railway.app/** to the Redirect URLs list. So the redirect configuration is good to go on the Supabase side.
