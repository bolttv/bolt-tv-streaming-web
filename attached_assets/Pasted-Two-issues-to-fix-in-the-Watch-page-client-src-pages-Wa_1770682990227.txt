Two issues to fix in the Watch page (client/src/pages/Watch.tsx) and Hero Banner (client/src/components/HeroCarousel.tsx):
Bug: "Watch Now" button on the hero banner doesn't work on mobile
The hero carousel has a "Watch Now" button that links to /watch/{mediaId}. When tapping it on mobile, the video either doesn't play or the tap is swallowed by the Embla carousel's touch/swipe gesture handler. The same content plays fine when accessed from the content details page (episode list).
Please diagnose:

Is the Embla carousel intercepting tap events on the button? If so, add proper pointer-events handling or use Embla's watchDrag option to exclude button taps from swipe detection.
Check if the hero items from /api/content/hero are returning a valid nextEpisode.mediaId for Series content types. If nextEpisode is null and contentType is "Series", the Watch Now button links to /watch/{heroItemId} which is NOT a playable JW Player media ID — it's just the series ID. The fallback watchMediaId needs to resolve to an actual episode media ID.
Check the Watch page — when it fetches /api/content/${id} and the ID is a series ID (not a media ID), does it return content with a valid mediaId field? If content.mediaId is undefined, the player tries to load https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/${id} using the series ID, which will fail.

The fix should ensure that for Series content, the Watch Now button always resolves to a real JW Player episode media ID before navigating.
Feature: Auto-enter fullscreen on mobile when video plays
In client/src/pages/Watch.tsx, after the JW Player initializes and the "play" event fires, detect if the user is on a mobile device and automatically request fullscreen. This provides a native video experience and avoids layout issues with the player container on small screens.
Implementation:

After player.on("ready", ...), check if the device is mobile using window.matchMedia("(max-width: 768px)").matches or user agent detection
On the "play" event (first play only), call player.setFullscreen(true) which is JW Player's built-in fullscreen API
As a fallback, also try the native Fullscreen API on the player container element: playerContainerRef.current?.requestFullscreen() (with webkit/moz prefixes for Safari/Firefox)
Make sure the player container has playsinline disabled for iOS so it uses native fullscreen rather than inline playback

Do NOT change any backend routes, JW Player configuration, environment variables, or API endpoints. Only modify the frontend components.
