You are building a Next.js (App Router) homepage UI that visually matches the uploaded reference screenshots (HBO Max-style). Your job is to recreate the layout and component system as accurately as possible from the images — NOT to redesign.

HARD RULES
- Do NOT invent new layouts, colors, spacing, or typography. Match the screenshots.
- Do NOT “improve” the design. Rebuild what you see.
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling. No custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- Use responsive behavior similar to streaming apps: desktop-first fidelity, then scale down.
- If something is unclear, choose the safest minimal assumption and add a TODO comment.
- Keep everything as reusable components (HeroCarousel, ContentRow, PosterCard, Navbar, Footer).

TECH STACK
- Next.js 14+ App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- No external UI kits required (shadcn optional only if needed)
- Use static mock data in a single file for now (no APIs yet)

PRIMARY GOAL
Create a streaming-service home page that matches the reference screenshots:
- Dark cinematic background
- Top navigation centered items (Home, Series, Movies, HBO, Sports style spacing)
- Hero banner with left-aligned show metadata + Watch button
- Horizontal rows of poster cards with hover/focus behavior
- Subtle gradients and overlays like the screenshots

PAGES + FILES
- You will CREATE these files:
  - app/page.tsx
  - app/layout.tsx (if not already present)
  - components/Navbar.tsx
  - components/HeroCarousel.tsx
  - components/ContentRow.tsx
  - components/PosterCard.tsx
  - components/Footer.tsx
  - lib/mockData.ts

If any of these files already exist, your code should REPLACE the file contents entirely (not partial edits). Tell me explicitly which files are created vs replaced.

UI REQUIREMENTS (match screenshots)
NAVBAR
- Left: small logo
- Center: nav links like “Home / Series / Movies / HBO / Sports”
- Right: search icon, profile icon/avatar
- Sticky at top with subtle transparency/blur feel

HERO BANNER (Carousel)
- Full-width hero background image (16:9 feel), with dark gradient overlay
- Left content stack:
  - Brand/Original label (small)
  - Big title (large, cinematic)
  - Sub-metadata line (rating, season count, genre)
  - Description text (2 lines max)
  - Primary action button:
    - If content.type === "series": button label “Watch S1 E1”
    - Else (documentary/film): “Watch Now”
  - Secondary icon button “+” (add to list)
- Carousel auto-slides every ~6–8 seconds
- Dots indicator centered near bottom of hero like reference
- Right side arrow indicator optional (subtle) for manual navigation
- Maintain the “soft haze / vignette” feel with gradients (Tailwind overlays)

HOME SECTIONS (order exactly)
Create these horizontal content rows, each with a title and scrollable posters:
1) Featured
2) Recommended For You
3) Continue Watching (cards show progress bar + episode info under row)
4) Popular Series
5) Documentaries
6) Series
7) Movies
8) Browse by Sports

CONTENT ROW BEHAVIOR
- Each row: title on left, posters in a horizontal scroll container
- Poster cards are tall rectangles (like streaming posters), consistent gaps
- Hover/focus state:
  - Slight scale up
  - Stronger outline/border highlight on active card
  - Optional subtle shadow/glow
- Some rows include a small “New” / “New Episode” label on top-left of poster (mock this)

POSTER CARD DETAILS
- Image background cover
- Optional corner label (“New Episode”, “New”)
- 3-dot icon top-right (optional)
- For Continue Watching row: show a progress bar at bottom of card and small metadata text under the row

FOOTER (match your spec)
Footer links:
- Social: YouTube, X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok
- Accessibility
- Audio Description
- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Use
- Ad Choices
- Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information
- Info
- Help
Keep footer minimal, small text, spaced like streaming app.

DATA MODEL (mock)
In lib/mockData.ts define:
- heroItems: array of 5–7 items
- rows: array of row objects with title + items
Each item fields:
- id
- title
- type: "series" | "movie" | "documentary"
- heroImage
- posterImage
- rating (e.g., TV-MA)
- seasonCount (optional)
- genres (array)
- description
- isNew (boolean)
- isNewEpisode (boolean)
- continueProgress (0–1 optional)
- seasonEpisodeLabel (optional string, e.g., “S1 E1”)

DELIVERABLE FORMAT (VERY IMPORTANT)
Step 1: Output a UI SPEC (bulleted) that includes:
- Layout tree (Navbar > Hero > Rows > Footer)
- Spacing scale (what gaps/padding you’re using)
- Typography scale (nav, headings, hero title, metadata)
- Overlay approach for hero (gradient layers)
- Interaction states (hover/focus)
Step 2: Output the full code for each file listed above.
Step 3: Tell me exactly which files were CREATED vs REPLACED.

FINAL QUALITY CHECK
Before finishing:
- Confirm hero button label logic works (“Watch S1 E1” vs “Watch Now”).
- Confirm rows render in the exact order.
- Confirm carousel auto-advances and dots reflect active slide.
- Confirm hover/focus matches the “streaming UI” feel.
